# Create-a-Table-for-Roll20
This is to create a table of items or monsters for Roll20
Edit in notepad ++ or notepad. 
You can change the table name in line 19, or change it after running in Roll20.
In line 20, item names, while using the same format, change the names of objects to the names of the desired objects(monster names/items/etc.)
//I just copied all the names of these from my current compendium

Enjoy!

I used ChatGPT and JavaHints to verify the code 
I also used ChatGPT to help wrap the item list with replace functions, replacing spaces with quotes and removing book names.
